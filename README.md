# Learn Docker A  to Z

```
    Why is docker?
        First, we say you can create multi-container
        and you can run all of container at the same time
        but the main feature of docker is you don't need to install
        virtual environment any of the programing language.
        Just create a container in your machine,
        it will serve all of the dependency in other containers.
        So that means your machine will be faster than before.
        Life is easy..:)
